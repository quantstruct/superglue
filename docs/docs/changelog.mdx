# Changelog (2025-02-16 - 2025-02-17)

## Overview
This release introduces significant enhancements to the data transformation and schema generation processes within the GraphQL API, alongside improvements in documentation clarity and file parsing capabilities. Key updates include the integration of new dependencies for schema generation, enhancements to API configuration using AI, and refined error handling for better developer experience.

## 🚀 New Features
